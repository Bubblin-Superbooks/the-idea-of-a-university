<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>I. As To Physical Science, Of Course There Can Be No Real Collision Between It And Catholicism. Nature And Grace, Reason And Revelation, Come From The Same Divine Author, Whose Works Cannot Contradict Each Other. Nevertheless, It Cannot Be Denied That, In Matter Of Fact, There Always Has Been A Sort Of Jealousy And Hostility Between Religion And Physical Philosophers. The Name Of Galileo Reminds Us Of It At Once. Not Content   With Investigating And Reasoning In His Own Province, It Is Said, He Went Out Of His Way Directly To Insult The Received Interpretation Of Scripture; Theologians Repelled An Attack Which Was Wanton And Arrogant; And Science, Affronted In Her Minister, Has Taken Its Full Revenge Upon Theology Since. A Vast Multitude Of Its Teachers, I Fear It Must Be Said, Have Been Either Unbelievers Or Sceptics, Or At Least Have Denied To Christianity Any Teaching, Distinctive Or Special, Over The Religion Of Nature. There Have Indeed Been Most Illustrious Exceptions; Some Men Protected By Their Greatness Of Mind, Some By Their Religious Profession, Some By The Fear Of Public Opinion; But I Suppose The Run Of Experimentalists, External To The Catholic Church, Have More Or Less Inherited The Positive Or Negative Unbelief Of Laplace, Buffon, Franklin, Priestley, Cuvier, And Humboldt. I Do Not Of Course Mean To Say That There Need Be In Every Case A Resentful And Virulent Opposition Made To Religion On The Part Of Scientific Men; But Their Emphatic Silence Or Phlegmatic Inadvertence As To Its Claims Have Implied, More Eloquently Than Any Words, That In Their Opinion It Had No Voice At All In The Subject-matter, Which They Had Appropriated To Themselves. The Same Antagonism Shows Itself In The Middle Ages. Friar Bacon Was Popularly Regarded With Suspicion As A Dealer In Unlawful Arts; Pope Sylvester The Second Has Been Accused Of Magic For His Knowledge Of Natural Secrets; And The Geographical Ideas Of St. Virgil, Bishop Of Saltzburg, Were Regarded With Anxiety By The Great St. Boniface, The Glory Of England, The Martyr-apostle Of Germany. I Suppose, In Matter Of Fact, Magical Superstition And Physical Knowledge Did Commonly Go Together In Those Ages: However, The Hostility Between Experimental Science And Theology Is Far Older Than Christianity. Lord Bacon   Traces It To An Era Prior To Socrates; He Tells Us That, Among The Greeks, The Atheistic Was The Philosophy Most Favourable To Physical Discoveries, And He Does Not Hesitate To Imply That The Rise Of The Religious Schools Was The Ruin Of Science.</h4></div> </div>
