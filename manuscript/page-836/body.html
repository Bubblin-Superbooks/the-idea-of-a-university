<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">what has not yet been proved. It is sufficient for me to repeat what I have already said, that they are founded upon a mere assumption. <em>Supposing</em>, indeed, religious truth cannot be ascertained, <em>then</em>, of course, it is not only idle, but mischievous, to attempt to do so; <em>then</em>, of course, argument does but increase the mistake of attempting it. But surely both Catholics and Protestants have written solid defences of Revelation, of Christianity, and of dogma, as such, and these are not simply to be put aside without saying why. It has not yet been shown by our philosophers to be self-evident that religious truth <em>is</em> really incapable of attainment; on the other hand, it has at least been powerfully argued by a number of profound minds that it <em>can</em> be attained; and the onus probandi plainly lies with those who are introducing into the world what the whole world feels to be a paradox.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
