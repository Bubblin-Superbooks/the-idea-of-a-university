Do you mean to say he does not study his subject? does he not make sketches? does he not even call them “studies”? does he not call his workroom a <em>studio</em>? is he not ever designing, rejecting, adopting, correcting, perfecting? Are not the first attempts of Michael Angelo and Raffaelle extant, in the case of some of their most celebrated compositions? Will any one say that the Apollo Belvidere is not a conception patiently elaborated into its proper perfection? These departments of taste are, according to the received notions of the world, the very province of genius, and yet we call them <em>arts</em>; they are the “Fine Arts.” Why may not that be true of literary composition</p></div> </div>
